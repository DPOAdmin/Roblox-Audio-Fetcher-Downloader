Creating an Audio Format Text File for Roblox Audio Fetcher GUI

To use the Roblox Audio Fetcher GUI tool, you need to create a text file containing a list of asset IDs. Follow these steps to create the required text file:

1. Open a Text Editor:
   - Use a plain text editor like Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (macOS) to create the text file.

2. List Asset IDs:
   - Each line in the text file should contain a single asset ID.
   - Separate multiple asset IDs with commas.
   - Example:
     ```
     asset_id_1,asset_id_2,asset_id_3
     ```

3. Save the Text File:
   - Save the text file with a `.txt` extension.
   - Choose a meaningful name, such as `audio_assets.txt`.

4. Place the Text File:
   - Put the text file in the same directory as the `audio.py` script.

5. Run the GUI:
   - Follow the usage instructions in the main README.md file to run the `audio.py` script.
   - Use the "Browse" button in the GUI to select the text file you created.

6. Download Audio Assets:
   - Click the "Download All Audio Files" button to start the download.
   - The tool will read the asset IDs from the text file and download the corresponding audio assets.

7. Enjoy:
   - You've successfully created and used an audio format text file with the Roblox Audio Fetcher GUI.
